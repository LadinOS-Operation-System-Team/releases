# Releases - A repo of LadinOS
Welcome to LadinOS community <br>
This repository is for storing releases and/or pre-releases.<br>
**We recommend that you use the releases page rather than cloning this repository to obtain the live CD, or perhaps (if supported) use our web page https://saladin510-orangeyouhome-erath.online download page to get the live CD.<br>**
## How to install
After booting the live CD from BIOS or UEFI, you should be able to use laupset (the installation script of LadinOS) to install programs. As a Linux distribution aimed at beginners, learning how to install Linux is very important. For this reason, we have adopted the same teaching method as Arch Linux. This way, it wonâ€™t cause unnecessary trouble for the community or for you (especially yourself).
